cloud: aws
clusters: 2

  #dr_licenses: "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"

# NOTE: edit env.dr_licenses above, or define in defaults.yml
# Verify all is working with `storkctl get clusterdomainsstatus` (take around 7 minutes)
# Stop the nodes on cluster 1
# Mark cluster 1 as down with `kubectl apply -f /assets/metro-c1-down.yml` on master-2
# Scale up on cluster 2 with `storkctl activate migration` on master-2
