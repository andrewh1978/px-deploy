large scale test needed as clouddrive destroy function has been changed (now running after terrform destroy) (all platforms/clouds)

OK use data source for rancher ami id 
-> test on other regions

? create option for rancher_domain or merge with ocp4_domain

multiple clusters, handle exceptions for clusters (nodes,types...)

? route53 for workload clusters
? aws elb for l4
? no external IP for cluster nodes

TODO:
implement run_everywhere
secure rancher cluster PW handling
test AWS key change during runtime (new key on deletion)

KNOWN ISSUES:
cloud-init check sometimes shows errors
creation of downstream clusters sometimes fails because amazonec2 node driver not yet cloudInitReady (unknow schema error)

terraform destroy failing on helm releases because they're throwing error. 
current workaround: remove helm releases from terraform state
terraform -chdir=/px-deploy/.px-deploy/tf-deployments/dpaul-rancher/ state rm helm_release.cert_manager 
terraform -chdir=/px-deploy/.px-deploy/tf-deployments/dpaul-rancher/ state rm helm_release.rancher_server
